-Hub was one of the earliest networking devices, developed to let local systems communicate among themselves.
-It receives data and broadcasts to all devices(ports) connected without knowing who is the real receiver.
-It works only on physical layer (Layer 01).
-It has no MAC address, can't filter data, can't prioritize packets, can't block devices.


### The drawbacks
- i) loaded with too much of data traffic.
- ii) thus, collision (i.e. multiple devices send data at same time.)
-     After collision device detect collision (CSMA/CD) wait for some time and resends data. 
- iii) no privacy or security.
- iv) very slow as systems gets added. (Bandwidth is shared among devices)
- v)  half-duplex (i.e. can't send or receive data simultaneously.)

Because of these drawbacks we no longer (or rare of the rarest time ) use hub in modern tech.
