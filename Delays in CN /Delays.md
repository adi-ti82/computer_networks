# 4.1. Bandwidth
- Bandwidth ia the maximum data-carrying capacity of a communication channel per unit time.

### Two different measuring values: 
- 1) Bandwidth in Hertz: 
  - tells how wide the frequency pipe is.
  - Basically, range of frequency a signal or channel occupies.
  - Bandwidth(Hz) = f<sub>high</sub> - f<sub>low</sub>
  
  
- 2) Bandwidth in bits/sec:
   - tells how much daat flows through the pipe.
   - number of bits transmitted per sec.
 
     
### Units:
- bps: bits per sec
- Kbps: kilobits per sec
- Mbps: megsbits per sec
- Gbps: gigabits per sec

###Examples:
- 100 Mbps bandwidth means:- up to 100 million bits can be transmitted per sec through the channel.

### Explain like a five:-
-Analogy is similar like more water can cross through a thick pipe at a time but only a little through thin one.
- In our case, water is the data packets and pipe is communication channel like wire, fiber cable or even air.
- So, Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data packets (water) that can cross the channel at a time.
- The more the data (water) flow the higher is the bandwidth.

# Isn't it a fact that air is huge (infinite), then why are we limited to 10Mbps or 100 Mbps etc?
### Understand:-
- Data isn't sent directly throught air, we uses EM waves to do so.
- Data is converted to Radio waves, which uses specific frequency bands and these bands are finite.

### We are limited to a fixed capacity because:
- 1) more frequency width = more bandwidth but Spectrum is finite.
- 2) Noise is there in air and it limits how much data we can safely pack.
- 3) Shared Medium, more users less bandwidth per user.
