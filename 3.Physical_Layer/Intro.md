# Intro to Physical Layer
- The major functions of the physical layer is to move data in the form of electromagnetic signals across a transmission medium.
- We deal with "data" (abstract information like photos or numbers), the physical world deals with "energy" (signals).
- For transmission, data needs to be changed to signals.
- Without this conversion, communication between computers would be impossible because transmission media can only conduct energy, not raw data.
